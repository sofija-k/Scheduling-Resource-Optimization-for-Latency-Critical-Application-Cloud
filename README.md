# Scheduling-Resource-Optimization-for-Latency-Critical-Application-in-the-Cloud
Deployed the latency-critical application `Memcached` in a Kubernetes cluster on Google Cloud to assess the impacts of hardware resource interference. Evaluated eight PARSEC batch workloads for sensitivity to resource interference on an 8-core VM and developed a scheduling policy to optimize resource allocation, targeting minimal completion times while maintaining a 1 ms 95th percentile latency for `Memcached` at 30K queries per second. Dynamically adjusted resource allocations while co-scheduling batch workloads with Memcached on 4-core server, with effectiveness evaluation through various load traces.
